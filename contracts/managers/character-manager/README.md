# Character Manager

This manager is a basic 1/1 minter. It mints a token with a given Character Metadata to the sender (or a gifted address). The token_id is simply incremented by one. There is no token limit but there is a fixed mint price that is burned. This manager will have the option to mint empty (unequipped with traits) characters or pre-made locked characters (like special offers)
